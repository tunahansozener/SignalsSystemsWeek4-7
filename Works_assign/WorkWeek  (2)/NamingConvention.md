**Unacceptable File Names**

We have recently noticed that some of the file names submitted are not meeting our acceptable standards. It's important to maintain professionalism and clarity in our file naming conventions to ensure seamless organization and communication within our educational environment.

Upon reviewing the submitted files, we've identified certain names that do not align with our guidelines. It's crucial to understand that clear and descriptive file names are essential for efficient management and collaboration. Therefore, I kindly request all students to adhere to the following guidelines when naming files:

1. **Clarity**: Ensure that the file name clearly reflects the content and purpose of the file. Avoid vague or ambiguous names that may cause confusion.

2. **Relevance**: Keep the file name relevant to the context of the assignment or project. Irrelevant or misleading names can lead to misunderstandings.

3. **Avoid Special Characters**: Refrain from using special characters, symbols, or spaces in file names as they may cause compatibility issues or difficulties in accessing the files.

4. **Length**: Keep file names concise while providing enough information. Lengthy file names can be cumbersome and may get truncated in certain systems.

5. **Use of Dates**: When applicable, consider including dates in the file name to indicate versions or submission deadlines.
