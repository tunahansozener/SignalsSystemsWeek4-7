1. Variable Assignment and Output: Write a MATLAB script that assigns the value 5 to a variable x and the value 3 to a variable y, then displays the result of x multiplied by y.

x = 5;
y = 3;
result = x * y;
disp(result)

2. Simple Arithmetic Operations: Create a MATLAB script that calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers 10 and 3.

x = 10;
y = 3;
sum = x + y;
difference1 = x - y;
difference2 = y - x;
product = x * y;
quotient1 = x / y;
quotient2 = y / x;

disp("Sum of x and y: " + sum + "\n");
disp("Difference is 3 from 10: " + difference1 + "\n");
disp("Difference is 10 from 3: " + difference2 + "\n");
disp("Product: " + product + "\n");
disp("Division 10 divided by 3: " + quotient1 + "\n");
disp("Division 3 divided by 10: " + quotient2 + "\n");

3. Conditional Statement: Write a MATLAB script that takes an input value num and prints "Even" if num is even, and "Odd" if num is odd.

num = input("Please enter a number: ");
if mod(num, 2) == 0
	disp("Number is Even");
else
	disp("Number is Odd");
end

4. Looping: Write a MATLAB script that uses a loop to display the first 10 multiples of 3.

for i = 1:10
    multiple = 3 * i;
    disp(["Multiple of 3 #" num2str(i) ": " num2str(multiple)]);
end

5. Vector Operation: Create a MATLAB script that defines a vector v containing the numbers 1 through 5, then calculates and displays the sum of the elements in v.	

v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
sum = 0;

for i = 1:length(v)
    sum = sum + v(i); 
end

disp("Sum of elements in v: " + sum);
