1.Write a MATLAB script that assigns the value 5 to a variable x and the value 3 to a variable y, then displays the result of x multiplied by y.

x = 5;
y = 3;
res = x * y;
disp(res)

2.Create a MATLAB script that calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers 10 and 3.

x = 10;
y = 3;
total = x + y;
sub1 = y - x;
sub2 = x - y ;
multi = x * y;
div1 = x / y;
div2 = y / x;

disp("Addition of x and y: " + total + "\n");
disp("Substraction is 3 from 10: " + sub1 + "\n");
disp("Substraction is 10 from 3: " + sub2 + "\n");
disp("Multiplication: " + multi + "\n");
disp("Division 10 / 3: " + div1 + "\n");
disp("Division 3 / 10: " + div2 + "\n");

3.Write a MATLAB script that takes an input value num and prints "Even" if num is even, and "Odd" if num is odd.

num = input("Please enter a number: ");
if mod(num, 2) == 0
	disp("your number is even");
else
	disp("your number is odd");
end

4.Write a MATLAB script that uses a loop to display the first 10 multiples of 3.

for i = 1:10
    multi = i * 3;
    disp(["Multiples of 3" num2str(i) ": " num2str(multi)]);
end

5.Create a MATLAB script that defines a vector v containing the numbers 1 through 5, then calculates and displays the sum of the elements in v.	

v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

total = 0;

for i = 1:length(v)
    total = total + v(i); 
end

disp("Addition of elements in v: " + total);
