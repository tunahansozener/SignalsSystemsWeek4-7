Code the answer below in Matlab

1. **Variable Assignment and Output:**
   Write a MATLAB script that assigns the value 5 to a variable `x` and the value 3 to a variable `y`, then displays the result of `x` multiplied by `y`.

2. **Simple Arithmetic Operations:**
   Create a MATLAB script that calculates and displays the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers 10 and 3.

3. **Conditional Statement:**
   Write a MATLAB script that takes an input value `num` and prints "Even" if `num` is even, and "Odd" if `num` is odd.

4. **Looping:**
   Write a MATLAB script that uses a loop to display the first 10 multiples of 3.

5. **Vector Operation:**
   Create a MATLAB script that defines a vector `v` containing the numbers 1 through 5, then calculates and displays the sum of the elements in `v`.

These questions focus on fundamental concepts like variable assignment, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, loops, and basic vector operations, making them suitable for beginners learning MATLAB.
