### Explanation:

The choice of the exponential decay factor (0.8 in this case) affects the amplitude decay rate of the generated signal. When the exponential decay factor is less than 1, such as 0.8, the amplitude of the signal decreases exponentially as time progresses. A smaller decay factor results in a slower decay rate, while a larger decay factor causes a faster decrease in amplitude. Modifying this factor to a different value will alter the rate at which the signal decays over time.
